Physical address is the address of a memory cell in primary memory.
Like an offset from the very beginning of physical memory to this cell.
Data can be obtained from RAM by this addresses.

Virtual address is an abstraction of an address. There is abstract, potentially infinite virtual memory for
a user, because the user doesn't want to be bothered my hardware limitations. Nevertheless, as the actual data is
stored in the existing primary memory, used virtual addresses should be mapped onto physical ones.
