DEFAULT BUFFER SIZE:

real    0m0,002s
user    0m0,002s
sys     0m0,000s

BUFFER OF 8 bytes:
real    0m0,003s
user    0m0,002s
sys     0m0,000s

Buffer is too small so a lot of read calls are needed which slows down the program

BUFFER OF 65536 bytes:
real    0m0,003s
user    0m0,002s
sys     0m0,000s

Buffer is too large, handling it requires more time than it wins

DEFAULT BUFFER WITH O_SYNC:
real    0m0,564s
user    0m0,005s
sys     0m0,000s

Synchronization makes program very slow as every call becomes blocking in a way
